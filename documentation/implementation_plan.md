# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Verify that Node.js is installed by running `node -v` in the terminal (Project Overview: Core Technologies).
2.  Install Node.js if it is not present using the latest LTS version (Project Overview: Core Technologies).
3.  Initialize a Git repository in the project root and create `main` and `dev` branches (Project Overview: Purpose).
4.  Create the project directory structure with two main folders: `/frontend` and `/backend` (Project Overview: Core Technologies).
5.  Install the Supabase CLI (if needed) and configure access by setting up environment variables for Supabase credentials; create a configuration file at `/backend/config/supabase.js` (Backend & Data Storage).
6.  **Validation**: Confirm Node.js installation with `node -v` and list Git branches using `git branch`.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Initialize a new React project inside the `/frontend` directory (Tech Stack: Frontend).
2.  Configure the project to use a dark mode default theme with near-black background (#121212), off-white/light gray text (#F5F5F5), and electric blue (#3E9EFF) accents; set the chosen sans-serif font (Montserrat, Poppins, or Roboto) (UI/UX & Frontend Considerations).
3.  Create a main layout component at `/frontend/src/layouts/MainLayout.js` that includes a dark mode theme and responsive design (UI/UX & Frontend Considerations).
4.  Create a header/navbar component at `/frontend/src/components/Navbar.js` featuring the app name, logo, and hamburger menu (UI/UX: Dashboard Structure).
5.  Create individual page components for Home, Dashboard, GenerateWorkoutPlan, WorkoutLogs, and Profile in `/frontend/src/pages/` (User Flow).
6.  Set up routing in `/frontend/src/App.js` using React Router to navigate between Home, Dashboard, GenerateWorkoutPlan, WorkoutLogs, and Profile (User Flow).
7.  Develop the Home page (`/frontend/src/pages/Home.js`) with a hero section, tagline, call-to-action buttons, and sections for features and upcoming features (UI/UX: Home Page).
8.  Build a workout plan generation component (`/frontend/src/components/GenerateWorkoutPlan.js`) that will interface with the backend AI services (AI Integration: OpenAI API).
9.  Create a dashboard view in `/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js` that displays charts and graphs for key metrics; integrate a charting library if needed (UI/UX: Dashboard Structure).
10. Create a user profile component at `/frontend/src/pages/Profile.js` that allows editing of user details and syncs with Supabase Auth (User Flow: Profile Setup).
11. Develop the export/import feature interface in `/frontend/src/components/ExportImport.js` that supports XLSX, PDF, CSV, and Google Sheets formats (Export/Import).
12. Build a notifications settings component at `/frontend/src/components/NotificationsSettings.js` allowing users to choose their preferred notification method (Notifications).
13. **Validation**: Run the React development server (`npm start` or equivalent) and manually verify that each page and component renders correctly and routing functions as expected.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Initialize a new Node.js project inside the `/backend` directory using `npm init` (Tech Stack: Backend).
2.  Install and configure Express in `/backend/server.js` to serve as the main server file (Tech Stack: Backend).
3.  In `/backend/config/supabase.js`, set up the Supabase connection using the stored credentials (Backend & Data Storage).
4.  Create authentication routes in `/backend/routes/auth.js` for user sign-up and login that use Supabase Auth (User Flow: Sign-up/Login).
5.  **Validation**: Test the authentication endpoints using Postman or a similar tool to ensure proper JWT generation and user handling (User Flow: Sign-up/Login).
6.  Create a profile management endpoint in `/backend/routes/profile.js` to handle storing and updating user information (User Flow: Profile Setup).
7.  Develop an endpoint at `/backend/routes/generateWorkout.js` that integrates with Perplexity AI for exercise research and OpenAI API for generating personalized workout plans (AI Integration).
8.  Create a macro calculation endpoint in `/backend/routes/macroCalc.js` that computes user macros based on the provided demographics and preferences (Key Features: Automatic macro calculation).
9.  Build an endpoint for progress tracking and bi-weekly check-ins in `/backend/routes/progress.js` (User Flow: Progress Tracking).
10. Implement export/import endpoints in `/backend/routes/exportImport.js` to support XLSX, PDF, CSV, and Google Sheets functionalities (Export/Import).
11. Develop notification endpoints in `/backend/routes/notifications.js` that record and deliver notifications via user-preferred channels (Notifications).
12. Implement data privacy and security measures in `/backend/config/security.js`, ensuring encryption in transit (HTTPS) and encryption at rest; enforce JWT verification on protected routes (Data Privacy/Security).
13. **Validation**: Write unit tests for each API endpoint (e.g., using Mocha/Chai) and run them to check for a 100% pass rate.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  In `/frontend/src/services/api.js`, create a service to wrap API calls to the backend endpoints (Integration).
2.  Integrate the frontend authentication flow by storing the JWT token from Supabase in local storage and sending it with API requests (User Flow: Sign-up/Login).
3.  Connect the profile page in the frontend to the `/backend/routes/profile.js` endpoint to support real-time profile updates (Changes in User Input/Feedback).
4.  Link the workout generation component on the frontend to the `/backend/routes/generateWorkout.js` endpoint so that triggering plan generation calls AI services (AI Integration).
5.  Connect the export/import interface on the frontend with the corresponding backend endpoints in `/backend/routes/exportImport.js` (Export/Import).
6.  Incorporate the notification settings component in the frontend to fetch and update user preferences with `/backend/routes/notifications.js` (Notifications).
7.  **Validation**: Perform an end-to-end test by simulating the complete workflow: user sign-up, profile update, workout plan generation, macro calculation, and notification preference setting.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Deploy the frontend React application to Vercel by configuring the project repository in the Vercel dashboard and setting the default dark mode (Tech Stack: Frontend).
2.  Deploy the Node.js backend server using a cloud solution (e.g., as a serverless function on Vercel or a separate Node deployment) and configure environment variables for Supabase and API keys (Backend Development).
3.  Set up environment variables on the deployment platforms for both frontend and backend (Tech Stack: Backend & Frontend).
4.  Configure CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions that run tests on commit and automatically deploy to Vercel (Development Tools: Cursor, Vercel).
5.  Integrate monitoring and logging tools (such as Sentry) for both the frontend and backend to track errors and performance (Data Privacy/Security).
6.  **Validation**: Conduct production end-to-end tests (using tools like Cypress) to ensure full connectivity, performance, and security compliance.

## Additional AI & Notification Integration

1.  In `/backend/services/email.js`, set up an email notification system using nodemailer for sending email alerts (Notifications).
2.  In `/backend/services/pushNotifications.js`, integrate push notifications support using a service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (Notifications).
3.  Create an in-app notifications component in `/frontend/src/components/Notifications.js` to display alerts received from the backend (Notifications).
4.  **Validation**: Trigger test notifications for email, mobile push, and in-app channels to verify proper delivery and logging (Notifications).
5.  Final review: Audit the data encryption processes in the backend and verify that user-specific data is securely separated from the general memory bank (Data Privacy/Security).
