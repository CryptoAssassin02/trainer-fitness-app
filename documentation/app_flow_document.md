# trAIner App Flow Document

## Introduction

trAIner is an all-in-one AI fitness app that helps users create personalized workout plans and macro goals tailored to their unique demographics, fitness levels, and preferences. The app combines secure authentication, modern design ideas, and advanced AI integrations to offer users a seamless and evolving fitness journey. It uses Supabase for authentication and data storage, Perplexity AI for gathering exercise research, and the OpenAI API to generate custom workout plans. Whether the user is a beginner or an advanced fitness enthusiast, the app ensures that every step of their fitness planning is guided and adaptable.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first visits trAIner, they are greeted by a modern landing page that features the app’s sleek design, dark mode as the default, and vibrant electric blue accents. The landing page provides clear call-to-action buttons prompting the user to sign up or log in. For those who are new, the sign-up process is straightforward: users are asked to provide their name, email, and a password. All this information is securely handled by Supabase authentication routines to ensure safety and privacy. Returning users simply enter their email and password to access their account. In addition, if a user forgets their password, there is an easy-to-find recovery option that allows them to reset their password via a secure email link. This initial process lays the foundation for a secure and user-friendly experience right from the start.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successfully logging in, users are taken to a dynamic dashboard that serves as the central hub of the application. The dashboard displays a consistent header with the app’s logo and a hamburger menu that makes navigation easy. On the main page, users can see key metrics that are relevant to their fitness journey, including upcoming workouts, workout logs, macro progress, and overall goal tracking. The layout is designed with clear sections, and visual elements like charts and graphs help to quickly communicate progress and insights. The intuitive design ensures that users can move effortlessly from the home view to other areas of the app, such as generating workout plans or editing their personal profiles.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

From the main dashboard, users have the option to generate a new workout plan once they have completed their profile setup. When a user clicks the “Generate Workout Plan” button, the app launches a two-step AI-embedded process. First, Perplexity AI conducts research by scanning reputable fitness sources and best practices, and then the OpenAI API uses that research along with the user's demographics, fitness preferences, and goals to generate a detailed and personalized workout plan. Once generated, the workout plan is displayed on a dedicated review page where users can read through each exercise recommendation and understand the underlying techniques such as supersets, drop sets, and rest-pause sets. If the user wishes to make changes, they are provided with a hybrid editing interface. They can manually adjust individual components like exercise type, repetitions, or workout days, or they can simply use natural language descriptions to ask the AI to make specific adjustments. As users edit and refine their workout routine, all changes are immediately updated on the dashboard and saved persistently in the Supabase database, ensuring that their progress is continually captured.

In addition to workout plans, the app also integrates a macro goal and nutritional tracking feature. Based on the user’s input in their profile, the app automatically calculates macros by taking into account factors like age, gender, height, and weight, as well as adjusting for workout frequency. This macro information is then clearly displayed alongside workout metrics within the dashboard. Over time, users are encouraged to check in on their progress with bi-weekly updates. A dedicated progress check-in page allows users to input workout details, body measurements, and other metrics that are then compared with their original goals. This progress data helps in refining future workout plans and ensures that the app dynamically adapts to users’ changing fitness needs.

Furthermore, the app provides export and import functionality to allow users to manage their workout plans outside the app. Users can export their personalized plans in several common formats such as XLSX, PDF, CSV, or even directly to Google Sheets, so that they can share or review their data offline. If needed, users can also import workout plans back into the app. The import functionality is designed to parse the data correctly and update the dashboard with any modifications, ensuring seamless transitions between external tools and the trAIner app interface.

A robust notification system is implemented to keep the user engaged and informed. Once their preferences are set, users receive reminders and alerts which may take the form of mobile push notifications, email reminders, or in-app messages, depending on what they choose. These notifications remind users when it is time to complete their workouts, log progress, or even alert them when a workout plan is about to end. Every notification is designed to help keep the fitness journey on track without overwhelming the user.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the app, users have access to a settings area where they can manage their account information and personal preferences. This section allows users to update details such as their personal demographics, fitness preferences, or even modify their workout and nutritional goals. They can also adjust notification settings to choose their preferred channels for receiving alerts. This section is designed to be accessible from the primary navigation, ensuring that users can quickly make changes and see the effects reflected in the other areas of the app. Additionally, options for logging out or deleting the account itself are available, which are seamlessly integrated to maintain a secure and user-friendly experience. Once users finish updating their settings, they can effortlessly return to the main dashboard to continue their fitness journey.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

trAIner is designed to handle a variety of error states and alternative paths without causing disruption to the user experience. When users enter invalid data during sign-up or profile updates, clear and simple error messages are displayed near the respective forms, explaining what went wrong and how to fix it. If there is a network or connectivity issue, the app provides fallback pages that notify the user of the problem and offer options to retry or check their connection. Similarly, if users attempt actions that are not permitted, such as making unauthorized changes or migrating data in an unsupported format, the app guides them with instructions and friendly alerts. This proactive error management system ensures that occasional issues do not break the seamless flow of the application and that users are always informed about the next steps to regain normal functionality.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The trAIner app offers a complete and coherent fitness journey beginning with a modern landing page that invites new users to sign up with reliable security measures in place. Once logged in, the user is immersed in a dynamic dashboard that serves as the central hub for all activities, from generating and editing personalized workout plans to tracking progress through periodic check-ins. The experience is enriched by AI-driven features that blend user input with exercise research and natural language processing for plan edits, ensuring that every workout and macro goal remains relevant over time. Alongside these core features, detailed settings and robust error management ensure that the app is both adaptable and resilient. In the end, users experience a fluid and engaging journey that supports them in achieving their fitness goals with precision and intelligence, creating a lasting and empowering relationship with their personal wellness activities.
