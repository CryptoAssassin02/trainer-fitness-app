## Deployment Preparation

Before deploying the application to production, run the preparation script to ensure all production dependencies are in place.

```bash
node scripts/prepare-for-production.js
```

This script performs the following checks:
- Verifies environment variables
- Ensures proper dependencies are installed (particularly replacing mock packages with real ones)
- Checks database connectivity
- Validates API key access

The script will prompt for confirmation before making changes.

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 18 or higher
- Access to production environment variables
- Access to database credentials
- Proper API keys (Perplexity, OpenAI, Clerk)

### Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your production environment:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
```

### Deployment Steps

1. Run the deployment readiness check:

```bash
node scripts/deploy.js
```

2. If the check passes, proceed with the deployment:

```bash
# For Next.js deployment to Vercel
vercel --prod

# For other environments, follow platform-specific steps
```

3. After deployment, verify the application is functioning correctly by running:

```bash
node scripts/test-e2e.js
```

## Continuous Integration

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration:

### CI Workflow

The CI workflow runs on every push to main and develop branches, as well as on pull requests to these branches.

It performs:
- Dependency installation
- Code linting
- Building the application
- Running unit tests
- Checking for mock implementations in production code

### Manual Checks

Before merging to main, ensure:

1. All tests pass locally
2. The deployment readiness check passes
3. End-to-end tests pass
4. There are no mock implementations that shouldn't be in production

## Monitoring

The application includes a monitoring script that checks the health and performance of the application at regular intervals.

### Starting the Monitor

```bash
# Run with default settings (5-minute interval, 60-minute duration)
node scripts/monitor.js

# Custom interval and duration
node scripts/monitor.js --interval 10 --duration 120

# Run indefinitely
node scripts/monitor.js --duration 0

# Custom output file
node scripts/monitor.js --output custom-monitor-logs.json

# Verbose logging
node scripts/monitor.js --verbose
```

### Monitoring Features

The monitor checks:
- API health endpoint
- Perplexity API integration
- Database connectivity
- System metrics (CPU, memory)

All results are logged to a JSON file for further analysis.

### Automated Alerts

For production environments, configure alerts when:
- Health checks fail consecutively
- API response times exceed thresholds
- Error rates increase above normal levels

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Mock Package in Production

If you see errors related to missing functions in the Perplexity package:

```
Error: The method X is not implemented in this environment
```

Run the preparation script to replace the mock with the real SDK:

```bash
node scripts/prepare-for-production.js
```

#### Environment Variable Issues

If you see errors related to missing environment variables:

```
Error: Missing required environment variable: X
```

Ensure all required environment variables are set in your environment.

#### API Rate Limiting

If you encounter rate limiting errors from Perplexity API:

```
Error: 429 Too Many Requests
```

The application includes retry logic, but you may need to:
- Implement additional caching
- Reduce the frequency of requests
- Contact Perplexity to increase your rate limits

### Debugging

For detailed logging during deployment:

```bash
DEBUG=app:* node scripts/deploy.js
```

For detailed monitoring logs:

```bash
node scripts/monitor.js --verbose
```

## Future Improvements

The following improvements are planned for future iterations of the deployment and monitoring systems:

### Metrics Dashboard
- Create a visual dashboard using the monitoring data
- Implement real-time graphs and alerts
- Add user-specific performance metrics

### Enhanced Alerting System
- Implement automated alerts for health check failures
- Set up notification channels (email, Slack, SMS)
- Create custom alert thresholds for different environments

### Load Testing Framework
- Add stress testing capabilities to verify scalability
- Simulate high-traffic scenarios
- Identify performance bottlenecks before they affect users

### Feature Flags System
- Implement a feature flag system for gradual rollouts
- Enable A/B testing of new features
- Allow quick rollback of problematic features

### AI Optimization
- Implement A/B testing for different AI prompts
- Optimize cache strategies for common AI queries
- Develop smarter fallback mechanisms for API failures

### Security Enhancements
- Regular automated security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- API key rotation and management system
